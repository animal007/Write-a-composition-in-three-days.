Dear Sir or Madam,
  The electronic dictionary was bought only a short period time in your online store by me, which has been found some problems.
  To the bigining, The electronic dictionary was fully charged by me ,however, the electronic dictionary was used for less than one hour. The electronic diction is not eligible, as a consequnce, the product reqirements are used for more than two hours in outdoor. Moreover, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are too small to impossible touch only one button which is needed.
  Therefore, the electronic dictionary should be changed another one which not only button is big but also product reqirements are reached. Your help is greatly appreiated.
                                            Yours sincerely,
