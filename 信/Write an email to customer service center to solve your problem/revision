Dear Sir or Madam,
  The electronic dictionary which was bought by me in your online store before only a short period time has been found some problems.
  To illustrate, the electronic dictionary with fully charged was used for less than one hour, which means it is not eligible as a consequence the product requirements introduce that working time more than two hours in outdoor. Moreover, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that they cannot be pressed accurately. 
  Therefore, the electronic dictionary should be changed another one whose not only button is big, but also product requirements are reached. Your help is greatly appreciated. 
                                                                                                                                                      Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                      Zhang Wei
