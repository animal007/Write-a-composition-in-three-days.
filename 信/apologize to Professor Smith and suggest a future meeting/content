Dear Professor Smith,
  The travel is looked forward by me which is planned to visit you.
  Unfortunately, the disease has recently been found in the physical examination which makes me not only cancel this travel, but also go to the hospital for treatment. I am so sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If possible, the travel would be planned in this year after my treatment is completed. The teatment will completed less than two weeks. Moreover, the situation will not happen again after the treatment. I apologize for any inconvenice this may cause you.
  Hope to see your reply and the time in future meeting.
                                             your sincerely,
                                             Li Ming
