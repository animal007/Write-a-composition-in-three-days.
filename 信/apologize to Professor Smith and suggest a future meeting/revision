Dear Professor Smith,
  The travel which is planned to visit you is looked forward by me.
  Unfortunately, the disease has been found recently in the physical examination, which makes me not only cancel this travel but also go to the hospital for treatment. I am so sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If possible, the travel would be planned in this year after my treatment is completed. The treatment will be completed less than two weeks. Moreover, the situation will not happen again after the treatment. There is my apology for any inconvenience which might be brought to you.
  Hope to see your reply and have a meeting in future time.
                                                                                                                                                        your sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                        Li Ming
