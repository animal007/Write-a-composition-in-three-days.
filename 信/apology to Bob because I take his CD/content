Dear Bob,
  the letter which I want to express my apologies for you is wrote for you.
  To begin with, the kind assistance which I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation you rendered me during my stay in Canada. During I stay in Canada, The CD of Bibo's which sounds very nice was borrpwed symphonies from you. Unfortunately, when I returned home, the CD was in my personal baggage due to my carelessness. I'm very sorry that I forgot to return this CD to you. 
  To solve this problem, this CD will be sent to you by Express Mail Service. Please acept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences that I have caused during I stay in Canada with you. Hope this processing mode will satisfy you.
                                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                    Li Ming
