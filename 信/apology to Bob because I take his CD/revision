Dear Bob,
	the letter in which I want to express my apologies for you is wrote for you.
  To begin with, many kinds of assistance for which I want to express my heartfelt appreciation was rendered to me when I stay in Canada. During that period of time, The CD of Bibo's which sounds very marvelous was borrowed to me as a result of your kindness.
Unfortunately, the CD was still in my personal baggage due to my carelessness when I returned home. It is my fault that I forgot to return this CD to you.
  To solve this problem, this CD will be sent to you by Express Mail Service. Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences that I have caused until I come back home. Hope this mode of solution will satisfy you.
	                                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely,
	                                                                                                                                                    Li Ming
